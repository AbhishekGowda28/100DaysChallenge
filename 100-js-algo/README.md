Given a sorted array of integers a, find an integer x from a such that the value of

    abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
is the smallest possible (here abs denotes the absolute value).
If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

> median
---
Given an array of integers a, find the median of the array.

**Example**

For a = [2, 4, 7], the output should be
median(a) = 4.

For a = [2, 4, 7, 6], the output should be
median(a) = 4.

For a = [2, 4, 7, 6, 6], the output should be
median(a) = 7.

For a = [2, 4, 7, 6, 6, 8], the output should be
median(a) = 7.

# Problem - 2:
1. Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.
2. Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers regardless of number of params.

**Example**

For param1 = 1 and param2 = 2, the output should be
add(param1, param2) = 3.

### Problem - 3
Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.

**Example**

For

    picture =   [
                    "abc",
                    "ded"
                ]
the output should be

    addBorder(picture) =    [
                                "*****",
                                "*abc*",
                                "*ded*",
                                "*****"
                            ]
